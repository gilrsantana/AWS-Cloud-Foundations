#### What is the AWS

* `Web Services:` Web Services is an application that is provisioning using internet. We only concerne what type dataset we provisioning to the service in order to do its job and then, we worry about what dataset the services give us back as response. We don't care about the implementation details (OS, programming language etc). The Web Services use an standard formmat interface to communicate (request and response). Generaly these interfaces are at JSON or XML standard.
