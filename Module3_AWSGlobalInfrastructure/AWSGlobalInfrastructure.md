#### AWS Regions

AWS has the concept of a `Region`, wich is a physical location around the world where  clusters data centers. Each group of logical data centers is an Availability Zone. Each AWS Region consists of a minimum of three, isolated, and physically separate AZs within a geographic area. Unlike other cloud providers, who often define a region as a single cata center, the multiple AZ design of every AWS region offers advantages for costumers. Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple AZs to achieve even greater fault-tolerance. AWS infrastructure Regions meet the highest levels of security, compliance, and data protection.

AWS provides a more extensive global footprint than any other cloud provider, and to suport itsglobal footprint and ensure customers are served across the world, AWS opens new Regions rapidly. AWS maintains multiple geographic Regions, including Regions in Noth America, South America, Europe, China, Asia Pacific, Soth Africa, and the Middle East.
